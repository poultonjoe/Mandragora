                    <p>You lose it here and you're in a world of hurt. Son of a bitch is dug in like an Alabama tick. That's a real nasty habit you got there. Long tall Sally, she's built for speed, she got everythin' that Uncle John need. Aw, I'm gonna have me some fun. I'm gonna have me some fun. I'm gonna have me some fun... I ain't got time to bleed... What's the matter? The CIA got you pushin' too many pencils? What the hell are YOU? Ain't no way for no soldier to die. This cabinet minister, does he always travel on the wrong side of the border? If these were central American then I'm a god damn chinaman.</p>
                    <p>I'm gonna have me some fun. You lose it here and you're in a world of hurt. Showtime, kid. My men are not expendable. And I don't do this kind of work. What's got Billy so spooked? Son of a bitch is dug in like an Alabama tick. Run! Go! Get to the chopper! Knock-knock. ...Bad idea. So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us in the meat grinder. What happened to you Dillon? You used to be somebody I could trust.</p>
                    <p>Knock-knock. I woke up. Why don't you? You're an asset, an expendable asset and I used you to get the job done. Got it? Strap this in your sore ass, Blain! Come on... Come on! Do it! Do it! Come on! Kill me! I'm here! Come on! Do it now! Kill me! If these were central American then I'm a god damn chinaman. Here we are again bro... Just you and me. Same kind of moon, same kind of jungle. Real number ten, remember... Whole platoon, thirty-two men chopped into meat... We walk out, just you and me, nobody else. Right on top, huh? Not a scratch... Not a fuckin' scratch. You know whoever got you, he'll come back again. And when he does I'm gonna cut your name, right into him... I'm gonna cut your name, right into him! I was going down on my girlfriend and said 'Sheesh, you got a big pussy. Sheesh, you got a big pussy.' And she said, 'Why did you say that twice?' And I said 'I didn't.' You know...it was the echo." This is a one way ticket. Once we cross that border... We're on our own. Run! Go! Get to the chopper! So, what are you gonna try next? Cheese?</p>
                    <p>You never were that smart... This place makes Cambodia look like Kansas. Son of a bitch is dug in like an Alabama tick. If it bleeds, we can kill it. So you cooked up a story and dropped the six of us in the meat grinder. What happened to you Dillon? You used to be somebody I could trust. Here we are again bro... Just you and me. Same kind of moon, same kind of jungle. Real number ten, remember... Whole platoon, thirty-two men chopped into meat... We walk out, just you and me, nobody else. Right on top, huh? Not a scratch... Not a fuckin' scratch. You know whoever got you, he'll come back again. And when he does I'm gonna cut your name, right into him... I'm gonna cut your name, right into him! What's got Billy so spooked? If these were central American then I'm a god damn chinaman. Maybe you better put her on a leash, agent man. What the hell ARE you?</p>
